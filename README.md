# dotfiles
dotfiles for my Hyprland desktop setup on NixOS. 

# Usage
See dependencies and more information in [my monolithic configuration.nix NixOS file](https://github.com/socd06/nixos-configuration).
They should work on their own on arch with some tweaking. 
I may convert or archive this repo when/if I transition to a home manager configuration.
Use at own risk.
